# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease using clinical parameters and supervised machine learning techniques. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses a CSV dataset of heart patient data.

---

## 📁 File

- `heart_prediction_code.ipynb` – The main notebook containing all code and analysis.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains various features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- Oldpeak, slope, number of major vessels, etc.
- **Target column**: 1 (presence of heart disease), 0 (no heart disease)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data handling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – For model building and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – As the development environment
